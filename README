Files included in this package :
    LowRAMP_UV.m : The main reconstruction code for UV' factorizarion
    run_LowRAMP_UX.m : a Demo file
    LowRAMP_XX.m : The main reconstruction code for XX' factorizarion
    run_LowRAMP_XX.m : a Demo file
    subroutines folder : all subroutines needed by the different parts of the algorithm. 
   
USAGE : from matlab, includes the two subfolders Functions and Subroutines (for instance using path(path,'./Functions');
path(path,'./Subroutines'); path(path,'./Functions');). Then  run the demo demo_LowRAMP_UV, demo_PCA_and_completion or demo_LowRAMP_XX
